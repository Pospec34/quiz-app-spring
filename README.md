Quiz Application
=================
This project is a console-based quiz application built with Spring Boot. It currently supports various quiz functionalities such as selecting categories, subcategories and taking quizzes with questions fetched from a database.

How it works
=================
- **Category Selection:** Users can choose from a list of categories for which they wish to take the quiz
- **Subcategory Selection:** After choosing a category, users can then choose from subcategories
- **Quiz Interaction:** Users can answer questions presented in a quiz format, with the application tracking user responses
- **Score Evaluation:** At the end of each quiz, users receive a score summary that shows their performance

Future Enhancements
=================
While the current version of the application serves as a console application, future development is planned to transition it into a web application.
